# UnicornVR
The most amazing VR game of all time

## Notes:
-  Multiplayer should be done using Unity's built in Network Manager https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Networking.NetworkManager.html
- One scene for offline/room search, one for the actual game
- DarknessDetector is currently in its own scene for testing purposes. Here it also displays the image on a quad. Don't know how to connect it to the jump functionality, but it should be easy
- I broke the camera when I made it multiplayer, working on a fix there :|
- It would be cool if the track turned sometimes, instead of always going forward
- Use deep learning to detect faceslaps?!?!?
- Use more unicorns!
